==============

Github branching strategy::


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dac55b58-d16d-4049-8a2b-4c3a8f979999)

main or master branch:: This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically.
main or master branch always stable and live code 

feature branch:: It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: feature/YYYY.MM.DD
 feature/2025.02.24

release branch:: Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle.
always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.02.24

hotfix branch:: always created from main or master branch only for production fixes.once production fix done we should merged directly to main or master branch only.

always created this hotfix branch for production issues fixes

bugfix:: this branch is created from release branch to fix the LLE(lower level environemnt)/Pre-Prod/UAT/Non-Prod issues and once LLE issues fixed ,we should pushed their changes to release branch only.

=============

1. completely we have occupied this session is issues resolutions and we will continue new topic in next session


27/02/2025::
============

If multiple developers OR DevOps Engineers are working on same Project/MOdules, if they tried to commits thier code changes to Repository, it will faces the  conflicts issues and how to resolved those conflicts issues in real time projects 


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bc72ca5-a9fd-407b-9d37-48824e5375b7)

Avoide conflicts:: Before pushing the code changes to github repository, make sure, you should be run the command -->git pull

>git pull --->git pull command is use, copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory (local directory) and merged code changes from remote repository to local repository 
>git fetch ---->The git fetch command only fetch the changes into your local Git repo and it will not merged anything. just fetch the details

Please create A,B,C directories in your local machine and clone the project code separately 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e786310-5092-4975-9eb9-7b18801353d8)

Editor steps for Resolved the conflicts::

editor::

1.press i from your keyboard, INCERT
2.press the esc from your keyboard at top left corner 
3.shift+:

Jenkins Introductiion::

Jenkins is a free and open source automation server/tool. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.

<img width="846" alt="jenkins overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffb9a0c8-0a8c-4b43-953e-36cd17297716" />

Jenkins is a Orchestration tool

Jenkins is a CI/CD tool

Jenkins is a Schedular

Jenkins is a crone job schedular 


Continuous Integration(CI)::the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple Developers into a single software project. It's a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository,after which automated builds and tests are run automatically.

developers frequently commit to a shared repository using a version control system such as Git,A continuous integration automatically builds and runs unit tests on the new code changes to immediately using jenkins Orchestration.

Continuous Delivery (CD)::Continuous Delivery is a software development practice in which code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production in a consistent and reliable manner. The key distinction of continuous delivery is that the process of deploying the code to production is done manually by a human decision-maker.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3be0abd-12cf-49a5-b1e5-e56d54ac1080)



Continuous Deployment(CD) :: Continuous Deployment is an extension of continuous delivery. With continuous deployment, every change that passes through the automated tests and builds is automatically deployed to production without any human intervention. The deployment process is fully automated.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03cd5335-7656-4b39-80c3-e7ba7a0234a9)


Roles And Responsibilities::

1)The devops engineer was responsibility to release the product to the market as soon as possible
2)release the product speed to the market
3)Devops engineer was give continues feedback to the developers
4) Devops engineer responsibility start from git and end with production

A) when your activity start from git and end with production environment(production servers)Continues deployment
when your activity start from git to LLE(lower level environment,testing environment,pre-prod…et) environment(pre-production servers)Continues delivery non-production environment

I'm going to created one free style job and configured Post-build Actions

In post build Action select the option Archive the artifacts

Execute the Jobs in Parallel::
==============================


1.By Default execute the Jenkins build jobs are sequence way,one by one 

2.Don’t do 2 projects build parallel  this is real time scenario but we can do parallel builds as well one job

Jenkins build parallel setup
Go job ---> configure ----> Generall ---> Execute concurrent builds if necessary

>ls target 

Post build action stage

Select archive the artifact
--target/*.jar

Junit test results::
--target/surefire-reports/*.xml

3.For every company will do sequence build on one project this is recommended approach

Please read and understand the below important point for parallel execuion job::
==================================================================================

When this option is checked, multiple builds of this project may be executed in parallel.
By default, only a single build of a project is executed at a time — any other requests to start building that project will remain in the build queue until the first build is complete.
This is a safe default, as projects can often require exclusive access to certain resources, such as a database, or a piece of hardware.

But with this option enabled, if there are enough build executors available that can handle this project, then multiple builds of this project will take place in parallel. If there are not enough available executors at any point, any further build requests will be held in the build queue as normal.

Enabling concurrent builds is useful for projects that execute lengthy test suites, as it allows each build to contain a smaller number of changes, while the total turnaround time decreases as subsequent builds do not need to wait for previous test runs to complete.
This feature is also useful for parameterized projects, whose individual build executions — depending on the parameters used — can be completely independent from one another.


I want to build the project using  Execute shell::
====================================================
at Build step select the Execute shell

Pipelines Introduction:::

A Jenkins pipeline is a series of automated steps or stages that define the process of continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) for your code. Jenkins, being a popular open-source automation server, uses pipelines to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code.

There are two types of Jenkins pipelines:

1. Declarative Pipeline
2. Scripted Pipeline

1. Declarative Pipeline::
The declarative pipeline syntax is simpler and more structured. It's the recommended style for most users because it's easy to read and maintain

Here's an example of a simple declarative pipeline:

pipeline{

agent any

stages{

Stage ('Clone'){

steps{

// write code
}
}

Stage ('Build'){
steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

Stage ('Test'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}
Stage ('Execute test casea and get the results'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

Stage ('Generated Artifact'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

Stage ('Deploy'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

// write code

}

}

Please try to create one pipeline job in jenkinsfile and execute the below Declarative pipeline example:;


pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Clone') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'feature/2025.02.27', url: 'git@github.com:parasa7358/spring-petclinic.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Test Results Reports') {
            steps {
                junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Artifacts') {
            steps {
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.war', followSymlinks: false
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}



Key elements in the declarative pipeline:::
======================================
pipeline: This is the top-level structure.
agent: Specifies where the pipeline will run, such as on any available agent, a specific node, or a Docker container.
stages: Defines the different steps or stages in the pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).
steps: Commands to be executed in each stage.


2. Scripted Pipeline::
   ==============

The scripted pipeline offers more flexibility, but it is less structured and can be harder to maintain. It uses Groovy syntax to define the pipeline.

Here's an example of a scripted pipeline:

node {
    try {
        stage('Build') {
            echo 'Building the application...'
            // Your build commands here
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            echo 'Running tests...'
            // Your test commands here
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            echo 'Deploying the application...'
            // Your deploy commands here
        }


        Please try to create one new jenkins pipeline job and execute below script for Scripted pipeline examples

        node {
        stage('Clone') {
                git branch: 'master', url: 'https://github.com/parasa7358/onlinebookstore.git'
			}
			
			 stage('Build') {
        
                sh 'mvn package'
        
			}
			stage('Test') {
        
                sh 'mvn test'
        
			}
        }



  Key differences in a scripted pipeline:::
  ==================================
node: Represents a Jenkins agent where the pipeline will run.


07/03/2025::
===============

Pipeline as Code::
==================
Both declarative and scripted pipelines are stored as Jenkinsfiles, which you place in your source code repository. This allows you to version control your pipeline and keep it aligned with your application code.

Declarative pipeline with Jenkinsfile::
===============================

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Clone') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'git@github.com:parasa7358/spring-petclinic.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Test Results Reports') {
            steps {
                junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Artifacts') {
            steps {
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.war', followSymlinks: false
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}


This pipeline:::

1 Checks out the source code from your Git repository.
2. Builds the project using Maven.
3.Runs unit tests.
4.Deploys the application using a custom script.

Tomcat Web Server: Introduction
===============

Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is primarily used to serve Java applications and is one of the most popular servlet containers in the world.

Tomcat is an essential tool for anyone working with Java web applications. It provides a simple, reliable platform for deploying and managing Java Servlets and JSPs and is widely used in both development and production environments. Its ease of use, combined with powerful features and flexibility, makes it an ideal choice for many developers working on Java-based web applications.

Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container that is primarily used to serve Java-based web applications. It implements several Java EE (Enterprise Edition) specifications, such as Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and WebSocket, among others. Tomcat is often used to run Java applications on the web because it's lightweight, easy to configure, and widely supported.

Here are some key points about Tomcat:

1. **Servlet Container**: Tomcat is a servlet container, meaning it manages the lifecycle of Java Servlets, which are small Java programs that run on a web server.
  
2. **JSP Support**: Tomcat also supports JavaServer Pages (JSP), a technology that allows for embedding Java code within HTML pages.

3. **Configuration**: It’s highly configurable through XML files, like `server.xml` for server settings, `web.xml` for application settings, and others.

4. **Lightweight**: Unlike full-fledged application servers like WildFly (formerly JBoss) or GlassFish, Tomcat is primarily a servlet and JSP container, which makes it lighter and easier to deploy for simpler Java web applications.

5. **Performance**: It’s known for good performance in handling static content, making it a popular choice for Java web developers.


Integrate Jenkins with Tomcat::

Integrating Tomcat with Jenkins is a common use case for automating the deployment of Java-based web applications. Jenkins can be set up to deploy a web application to a Tomcat server whenever a new build is triggered.

Prerequisites:

Apache Tomcat should be installed and running on your server.
Jenkins should be installed and running.

Steps to integrate Jenkins with Tomcat:

1. Install the "Deploy to Container" Plugin in Jenkins:
The easiest way to deploy to Tomcat from Jenkins is by using the Deploy to Container plugin. This plugin allows Jenkins to deploy WAR files to a Tomcat server.

Go to your Jenkins dashboard.
Click on Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
In the Available tab, search for Deploy to Container Plugin and install it.
Once installed, restart Jenkins to apply the plugin.

2. Configure Tomcat Server in Jenkins:
Now you need to tell Jenkins where your Tomcat server is running.

In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
Scroll down to the Deploy to container section.
Click Add Tomcat Server.

Provide the necessary information:
Name: Give the Tomcat server a name (Tomcat9).
URL: The URL of your Tomcat server (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
Username: The username for Tomcat's manager app (usually admin).
Password: The password for that username (set in Tomcat's tomcat-users.xml).
Save the configuration.

3. Configure Tomcat’s tomcat-users.xml:
Make sure Tomcat is set up to allow Jenkins to deploy the application by editing the tomcat-users.xml file.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7763560/401-unauthorized-error-while-logging-in-manager-app-of-tomcat

tomcat-users.xml file::
=========================

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61a0b6ae-1e6c-47d0-8852-b226d65f38a4)



  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
  <role rolename="manager-status"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <role rolename="admin-script"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, manager-status, admin-gui, admin-script"/>




Restart Tomcat to apply the changes.

4. Create a Jenkins Job to Build and Deploy the Application:
Next, you need to create a Jenkins job that will build your web application (e.g., a WAR file) and deploy it to Tomcat.

From the Jenkins dashboard, click New Item.

Select Freestyle Project, give it a name, and click OK.

In the job configuration, go to the Build section and configure your build step, such as building a Maven project For Maven, you can use:

> mvn clean install

In the Post-build Actions section, add Deploy war/ear to a container.

In the WAR/EAR files field, provide the path to your WAR file (e.g., target/my-app.war).
In the Container field, choose the Tomcat server you configured earlier.
Set the Context Path (e.g., IfocusAWSDevOpsTraining), which is the URL path where the application will be accessible on Tomcat.
If you want Jenkins to deploy automatically after every successful build, check the option Deploy after every successful build.
Save the job.

5. Trigger the Build and Deployment:
Go to the Jenkins job you just created and click Build Now to trigger a build.
After the build completes, Jenkins should deploy the WAR file to your Tomcat server.

You can access your application by going to http://<tomcat_host>:<tomcat_port>/<context_path>

example::  http://localhost:8080/IfocusApplication/

POLL SCM:: * * * * * (every minute automatic build & deployment happend when new commits happend in github)
This setup will allow Jenkins to automatically build and deploy your Java web application to Tomcat with each new build

AWS (Amazon Web Services)::
====================

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform offered by Amazon. It provides a broad set of services to help organizations and individuals build and scale applications, manage data, and process workloads in the cloud. AWS is designed to provide flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solutions for computing, storage, networking, machine learning, and much more.

AWS ---Amazon web services

compute services::
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Provides scalable virtual servers to run applications.
AWS Lambda: Lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales based on usage.

Storage services::
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage for storing and retrieving large amounts of data.
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store): Persistent block-level storage for EC2 instances.

Database::
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed relational database service supporting multiple database engines (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, etc.).
Amazon DynamoDB: A managed NoSQL database service.
Amazon Aurora: A high-performance relational database engine compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Network services::
Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Lets you create isolated networks within AWS for secure connections.

Security ::

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management): Controls user access and permissions for AWS resources.
AWS KMS (Key Management Service): Managed service for creating and controlling encryption keys.
Security groups ---inbound, outbould roles


Containers & kuberneties::
ECS  ---elastic containers servcies
EKS  ----estastic kuberneties services
AKS  ---Azure kuberneties services

Cloud watch --Metrics Monitoring

CloudWatch Metrics allows you to track the performance and utilization of AWS resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, Lambda functions, S3 buckets, and much more.
These metrics include CPU utilization, disk activity, network traffic, and others. You can create custom metrics for your applications or services as well.

cloud trail ---Security Monitoring:

Use CloudTrail logs to detect unauthorized access or activity in your AWS environment. You can track changes in security settings, unauthorized API calls, or unexpected configuration changes.

Developer Tools::
AWS CodeCommit: Source control service for managing your code repositories.
AWS CodeDeploy: Automates code deployments to EC2 instances and Lambda.
AWS CodePipeline: Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service for automating the release pipeline.

AWS EC2 ::
===========
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is one of the core services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Wide Variety of Instance Types:

EC2 instances are grouped into families based on the type of workload they are optimized for. Some common instance families include:
General Purpose: e.g., t3, m5 instances (balanced CPU, memory, and networking).
Compute Optimized: e.g., c5 instances (great for high-performance computing tasks).
Memory Optimized: e.g., r5, x1e instances (designed for high-memory workloads like databases).

Ansible::
============

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and multi-node orchestration. It helps system administrators and DevOps professionals automate IT processes to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and simplify complex workflows.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3d2b092-091c-479c-8198-e98dee9ab09f)


Key Features of Ansible:
================
Agentless: Ansible doesn't require any agents to be installed on the target machines. It uses SSH (or WinRM for Windows systems) to communicate with remote nodes.

Declarative Syntax: Ansible uses YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) to define the tasks, which makes it easy to read and write.

Idempotent: Ansible ensures that running the same playbook multiple times has the same effect, meaning it won’t reapply configurations if they’ve already been applied correctly.

Modular: Ansible has a large number of pre-built modules that can be used to manage various systems, applications, and services.

Playbooks: These are YAML files that describe the automation tasks you want to run. Playbooks are the heart of Ansible automation and define the "what" and "how" of your automation tasks.

Inventory Management: Ansible can manage an inventory of systems, which is used to organize and target different sets of machines.

Basic Components:
==================
Inventory: A list of hosts (machines) that Ansible will manage.

Playbook: A YAML file that defines the tasks and roles to be applied to the inventory.

Roles: A way to group related tasks and files together in a reusable manner.

Modules: Pre-built commands that Ansible can run on target systems to accomplish specific tasks (e.g., file management, system configuration, etc.).

Ansible Playbooks Introduction::
==========================

Ansible playbooks are the heart of automation with Ansible. They are simple YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) files that define automation tasks in a structured, human-readable format. Playbooks allow you to automate configurations, deployments, and orchestration tasks in a clear and organized way.

Key Concepts::
==============

Playbook: A playbook is a file that contains one or more "plays." Each play defines a set of tasks to be executed on a group of hosts. The playbook can be used for things like installing packages, managing users, configuring services, etc.

Task: A task is an individual unit of work. Tasks define specific actions, such as installing a package, starting a service, or copying a file. Tasks are executed sequentially, in the order in which they are written in the playbook.

Inventory: An inventory is a list of hosts that Ansible will manage. The inventory file defines which machines to target. An inventory can group hosts together (e.g., web servers, db servers) for easy management.

Modules: Ansible provides numerous modules that are responsible for performing specific tasks like managing packages, services, files, etc. Common modules include apt, yum, service, copy, and file.


Structure of a Basic Playbook:
===============================
A basic playbook has the following components:

YAML Header: The file begins with a --- to indicate it’s a YAML file.

 the hosts (target machines)
 become: yes   ----->Sudo user 

Tasks: Tasks define the actions to be executed on the target systems.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71982463-6b41-4481-af94-29c76690b0b6)

I want to see where the Ansible is installed on ACS
>cd /etc/ansible

NOTE::
==========
Playbook is written in YAML format
Inside the playbook tasks
Each task is a module
Playbook is a one of yaml file
Yaml file is a collection of key-value pairsset of all tasks
Playbook is tell to the ansible what are the tasks can be performed
Each task  one module
Module is a smallest item of ansible
Module can be used to individual or smallest task can be performed
Any configuration management tool should maintain ‘state’


hosts: all (apply all we can be mentioned in inventory )
become: yes  (become user as a sudo user)

       state: present
     
       update_cache: yes

     
note:::default state is present 
update_cache: yes tells Ansible to run the apt-get update command on the remote machine before performing any further package operations (like installing or upgrading packages).
become: yes  # Elevate privileges to execute tasks as root

Executing ansible in 2 ways
1.	Adhoc command  yearly base
2.	Playbook (YAML/YML) format use for repetitive work

When we can use adhoc commands  ->I want restart servers yearly base 

if you can use system inventory, below is the command
>ansible-playbook <playbookname>
>ansible-playbook hello-world.yml

I don’t want to use system level inventory

I want categories into Inventory groups::
===================================

In Ansible, inventory groups are used to organize and categorize hosts (machines or servers) into logical groups. This allows you to apply tasks to specific sets of servers, simplifying playbook management and execution. An inventory is a list of managed hosts and their associated metadata, and groups are one of the key components of that structure.

Here’s a detailed explanation of Ansible inventory groups

1. What Are Inventory Groups?
An inventory group in Ansible is a way to group hosts based on a shared characteristic. For example, you might have groups for different environments (e.g., dev, prod), different types of servers (e.g., web_servers, db_servers), or other logical categories that fit your needs.

static inventory groups defined in the standard INI or YAML format.

# Define groups of hosts:: >sudo vi hosts

[web_servers]

 ansiblenode1@172.31.20.135
 
 ansiblenode2@172.31.30.200
 
 localhost
 
[db_servers]

ansiblenode1@172.31.20.135

ansiblenode2@172.31.30.200

[app_servers]

i want to insatll 3 spfwares :: below playbook name -----> installsoftware.yml
==============================

---
- hosts: web_server
  
  become: yes
  
  tasks:
  
  -  name: install git
    
     apt:
     
       name: git
     
       state: present
     
       update_cache: yes

  -  name: install tree
    
     apt:
     
       name: tree
     
       state: present  

  -  name: install apache
  
     apt:
     
       name: apache2
     
       state: present

once above two files created run the below command

>ansible-playbook -i hosts installsoftware.yml
     
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36d33a9a-b113-402c-80f7-1e9c404a245b)

>ansible -i hosts -m ping Webserver

Best practice is you need to create our own inventories

>sudo vi hosts

after ran the above yaml, please try to access all machines with IPaddresss

Please enabled Inbound and Outbound rules::
=======================================

Inbound and outbound rules refer to the types of network traffic that are allowed or denied to and from a system, such as a server, virtual machine, or network device. These rules are typically defined in firewalls or security groups (such as in cloud environments like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud). The primary goal is to control which data can enter or leave a network, ensuring security and proper access control.

Here’s a detailed explanation of inbound and outbound rules:

 Inbound Rules::
Inbound rules control traffic entering a system or network. These rules define which types of external traffic are allowed to reach a server, instance, or device.

Common Uses:
Allowing specific users or services to access the system.

Restricting access to the system from unauthorized users.

Opening ports for services like web servers (HTTP, HTTPS), SSH, database connections, etc

Allowing incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP) so that users can access a web server.

Outbound Rules::
Outbound rules control traffic leaving a system or network. These rules define which traffic is allowed to exit a server or device and reach external destinations.

Common Uses:
Allowing a server to access external services like APIs, databases, or external servers.

Restricting unwanted traffic from the system to external destinations.

Controlling the flow of outgoing traffic to ensure compliance with security policies.

Allow HTTP/HTTPS: Allow outbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to any IP:

Install LAMP on ubuntu 24.04::
==================================

A LAMP stack stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, which is a popular open-source software stack used for web development. It provides everything you need to set up a dynamic website or web application.

Here’s a quick overview of each component:

Linux: The operating system (in this case, Ubuntu).

Apache: The web server that serves your website’s files.

MySQL: The database management system for storing and retrieving data.

PHP: The programming language used for dynamic web page generation.



Manual Steps::
====================

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu

>sudo apt update

>sudo apt install apache2

>sudo apt install mysql-server

>sudo apt install php

>sudo apt install libapache2-mod-php

>sudo apt install php-mysql

>sudo systemctl restart apache2

>sudo apt install php-cli

>sudo nano /var/www/html/info.php

above steps are manually installed all required softwares in LAMP project but my requirement is to write a Playbook for those manuall steps

Playbook for LAMP::  phppackage.yml

loop::

In Ansible, loops are used to repeat tasks over a list of items, making automation more efficient and reducing redundancy in playbooks. You can loop through arrays, dictionaries, and other types of data in Ansible to execute tasks multiple times.

There are several ways to use loops in Ansible, and here are the most common methods:

1. Using loop keyword
The loop keyword is the most common way to iterate over a list of items. Here's an example of how to use it:

https://spacelift.io/blog/ansible-loops

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_loops.html

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_loops.html


Examples::
==========

---
- hosts: Webservers

  become: yes

  tasks:

    - name: Install all packages
   
      apt:
    
	name: "{{ item }}"

        state: latest

     loop:
        -  apache2
        -  php
        -  php-mysql
        -  libapache2-mod-php
        -  php-cli
    -  name: restart apache

        service:

       name: apache2

        enabled: true

       state: restarted

    -  name: copy module info.php

       copy:

       src: info.php

       dest: /var/www/html/info.php  



Setup module in ansible::
============================


https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html
Setup module is used to collect the facts
Facts information gather from nodes called facts
>ansible -I hosts -m setup Webserver

Using filter command

>ansible -i hosts -m setup -a "filter=*os*" Webserver

ansible_os_family": "Debian"

Ansible when statements

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#the-when-statement


ansible_os_family": "Debian"

When condition is always used bottom of the script and using scrips we can able to run a playbook on a different platforms 

1.Debian
2.Redhat
---
- hosts: Webserver

  become: yes

  tasks:
  - name: install apache

    apt:
      name: apache2

    state: present

    update_cache: yes

    when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"  
  - name: install apache

    yum:

    name: httpd

     state: present

    when: ansible_os_family == "Redhat"




27/03/2025::
==============


In Ansible, variables are used to store values that can be referenced and used throughout your playbooks, roles, and tasks. This allows for dynamic, reusable, and flexible automation. Here’s a basic breakdown of how Ansible variables work and the different ways you can define and use them:


define variables in 3 places
1.	Inventory level  lowest priority
2.	Playbook level 
3.	Command line level –highest level priority


Inventory variables: These are defined in the inventory file (or dynamic inventory) for specific hosts or groups.

[webservers]
ansiblenode1@172.31.20.135  package_name=git
ansiblenode2@172.31.30.200 package_name=apache2
localhost 

[webservers:vars]
ansiblenode2@172.31.30.200 
localhost 

package_name=httpd

Playbook variables: You can define variables directly within your playbooks using the vars section.

---
- hosts: Webservers

  become: yes

  vars:

  pacakge_name: git

  tasks:
    
    - name: Install all packages

      apt:

      name: "{{ pacakge_name }}"

      state: present

      Command-line variables: You can pass variables to your playbooks at runtime using the -e or --extra-vars option.
      

      >ansible-playbook -i hosts -e "package_name=apache2" variables2.yml



Ansible resolves variable values based on a specific precedence order. The order from highest to lowest precedence is:
====================================================================================================================

Extra-vars (-e on the command line): Command-line variables take the highest precedence.

Playbook variables: Variables defined within the playbook.

Inventory variables: Variables set in the inventory.

Debug & vars & register in Ansible module::
==========================================

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/debug_module.html

---
- name: Echo message on localhost

  hosts: localhost

   connection: local

   gather_facts: no

   vars:

   message: "Hello from Ansible playbook on localhost!"

  tasks:
    
    - name: Echo message and connection type

      ansible.builtin.shell: "echo '{{ message }}' ; echo 'Connection type: {{ ansible_connection }}'"

      register: echo_output

    
    - name: Display output

      debug:

      msg: "{{ echo_output.stdout_lines }}"


>ansible-playbook -i hosts -vvv variable.yaml  --------> verbose logs purpose ,please run this command


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d18a6e5-a53b-436b-bf26-dbe1db0e89af)


Registry Module::
-----------------
Registry is a module used to results can be stored in a variable
Stored ouptput of a task or script
I want execute a command and results can be stored in a variable is called registry

Handlers::
===========
Sometimes you want a task to run only when a change is made on a machine. For example, you may want to restart a service if a task updates the configuration of that service, but not if the configuration is unchanged. Ansible uses handlers to address this use case. Handlers are tasks that only run when notified

---
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure apache is at the latest version
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: httpd
        state: latest
  handlers:
    - name: Restart apache
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted

Ansible Roles::
===================

Ansible roles are a way of organizing playbooks and tasks in a modular, reusable, and maintainable structure. They allow you to break down complex playbooks into smaller, focused units of functionality that can be easily shared and reused across different projects. Here's a more detailed look at Ansible roles:

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html

1.Written ansible in a reusable fashion
2.How do I use someone else’s work
3.Ansible galaxy is a place where we can find reusable roles

https://galaxy.ansible.com/

4.Which we can use in your script



install roles

 > Ansible-galaxy install <rolename>

 >ansible-galaxy install my_role

create my own role::

> ansible-galaxy init <rolename>

>ansible-galaxy init my_role



Structure of Ansible Roles::
===================

my_role/
├── defaults/
│   └── main.yml            # Default variables
├── files/
│   └── somefile            # Files to be copied to the target
├── handlers/
│   └── main.yml            # Handlers (usually for service restarts)
├── meta/
│   └── main.yml            # Metadata about the role
├── tasks/
│   └── main.yml            # The main tasks (this file includes other task files if needed)
├── templates/
│   └── config.j2           # Jinja2 templates for dynamic file creation
├── tests/
│   └── test.yml            # Test playbooks to verify the role works
├── vars/
│   └── main.yml            # Custom variables


Using Roles in Playbooks
Once you've defined a role, you can use it in your playbook like this:

---
- name: Example Playbook using roles
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  roles:
    - my_role

Benefits of Using Roles
Reusability: Roles can be reused across different playbooks and projects.

Modularity: Roles allow you to organize your playbook into smaller, manageable parts.

Clarity: Each role focuses on a specific task or function, making your playbooks more understandable.

Example Role: Installing Tomcat

https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/robertdebock/tomcat/install/


Create my own role

> Ansible-galaxy init rolename

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af275783-63b6-40ab-a319-645db283a40f)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34cfe34b-b8bc-4026-9014-0c07c952c3af)

Install tomcat

If you're looking to install or use an Ansible role for Tomcat from Ansible Galaxy, you can search for available roles and collections related to Tomcat. Here's how you can find and use a role related to Tomcat from Galaxy.
1.	Search for a Tomcat Role

https://galaxy.ansible.com/

To search for a role related to Tomcat on Ansible Galaxy, you can use the following command:
bash
Copy
ansible-galaxy search tomcat
This will return a list of roles related to Tomcat that you can install and use.
2. Install a Tomcat Role
Once you’ve found a suitable role for Tomcat, you can install it using the ansible-galaxy install command.
For example, if you find a role called geerlingguy.tomcat, you can install it by running:
bash
Copy
> ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.tomcat
This will download and install the role into your ~/.ansible/roles/ directory (or the path defined in your ansible.cfg file).
3. Use the Installed Tomcat Role in Your Playbook
After installing the role, you can use it in your playbook. Here’s an example of a simple playbook that installs and configures Tomcat:
yaml
Copy

Deploywar.yml::
=============

---
- hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  roles:
  - robertdebock.java
  - robertdebock.tomcat
 
  > ansible-playbook -i hosts Deploywar.yml
  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/306fd1fc-8c51-40f7-81b6-41a44e6ee915)

  
This will use the geerlingguy.tomcat role to set up Tomcat on your webservers hosts.

https://galaxy.ansible.com/robertdebock/tomcat

Most of the work is done 
Where is my war file

Deploy Onlinebook store war to tomcat server using roles::
==============================================================

>If war file is available in local machine use copy module
>if war file is available other machine(internet) use get_url module
Tomcat by default install

>/opt/tomcat
